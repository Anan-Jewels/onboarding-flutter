Objective: To build one screen in Flutter, linked to mock APIs

Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/Cp2f3DwCUnik5ktk59Xuk1/Ana-Jewels-Onboarding-Test-Flutter

Please build out the screen given, assuming that the data for each style shown comes from the mock API, given at: https://6525210567cfb1e59ce6ae75.mockapi.io/api/v1/designstyles

Additionally, please setup a mock API call to post back the user selection on next, and show an alert on click saying: "You have successfully saved {list user selected categories here}"
For example, if user selects classic and modern, alert will say "You have successfully saved classic, modern"

Note that:

1. API response could contain more or less than 9 items and the page should scroll to handle that
2. Images provided from the URL may be in varied color schemes and they should all present as greyscale as per the figma
3. Please keep your code as clean and easy to understand as possible.
4. Please add any instructions to the Readme if required with respect to running the project locally
